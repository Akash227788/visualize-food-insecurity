    "_IBM Journey showing how to visualize US Food Insecurity with Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics._\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in data science we do a great deal of work to glean insights that have an impact on society or a subset of it and yet, often, we end up not communicating our findings or communicating them ineffectively to non data science audiences. That's where visualizations become the most powerful. By visualizing our insights and predictions, we, as data scientists and data lovers, can make a real impact and educate those around us that might not have had the same opportunity to work on a project of the same subject. By visualizing our findings and those insights that have the most power to do social good, we can bring awareness and maybe even change. This Code Pattern walks you through how to do just that, with IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX), Pandas, Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular Code Pattern, food insecurity throughout the US is focused on. Low access, diet-related diseases, race, poverty, geography and other factors are considered by using open government data. For some context, this problem is a more and more relevant problem for the United States as obesity and diabetes rise and two out of three adult Americans are considered obese, one third of American minors are considered obsese, nearly ten percent of Americans have diabetes and nearly fifty percent of the African American population have heart disease. Even more, cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year, and rising. Native American populations more often than not do not have grocery stores on their reservation... and all of these trends are on the rise. The problem lies not only in low access to fresh produce, but food culture, low education on healthy eating as well as racial and income inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The government data that I use in this journey has been conveniently combined into a dataset for our use, which you can find in this repo under combined_data.csv. You can find the original, government data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics https://www.bls.gov/cex/ and The United States Department of Agriculture https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/."

    "### What is DSX, Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics and why should I care enough about them to use them for my visualizations?\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM's Data Science Experience, or DSX, is an online browser platform where you can use notebooks or R Studio for your data science projects. DSX is unique in that it automatically starts up a Spark instance for you, allowing you to work in the cloud without any extra work. DSX also has open data available to you, which you can connect to your notebook. There are also other projects available, in the form of notebooks, which you can follow along with and apply to your own use case. DSX also lets you save your work, share it and collaborate with others, much like I'm doing now!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixie Dust is a visualization library you can use on DSX. It is already installed into DSX and once it's imported, it only requires one line of code (two words) to use. With that same line of code, you can pick and choose different values to showcase and visualize in whichever way you want from matplotlib, seaborn and bokeh. If you have geographic data, you can also connect to google maps and Mapbox, depending on your preference. Check out a tutorial on Pixie Dust here: https://ibm-watson-data-lab.github.io/pixiedust/displayapi.html#introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM's Watson Analytics is another browser platform which allows you to input your data, conduct analysis on it and then visualize your findings. If you're new to data science, Watson recommends connections and visualizations with the data it has been given. These visualizations range from bar and scatter plots to predictive spirals, decision trees, heatmaps, trend lines and more. The Watson platform then allows you to share your findings and visualizations with others, completing your pipeline. Check out my visualizations with the link further down in the notebook, or in the images in this repo."

    "To summarize the introduction, you must first make an account and log in. Then, you can create a project (I titled mine: \"Diet-Related Disease\"). From there, you'll be able to add data and start a notebook. To begin, I used the combined_data.csv as my data asset. You'll want to upload it as a data asset and once that is complete, go into your notebook in the edit mode (click on the pencil icon next to your notebook on the dashboard). To load your data in your notebook, you'll click on the \"1001\" data icon in the top right. The combined_data.csv should show up. Click on it and select \"Insert Pandas Data Frame\". Once you do that, a whole bunch of code will show up in your first cell. Once you see that, run the cell and follow along with my tutorial!\n",

    "Once you've set up your account, you can see that the Watson plaform has three sections: data, discover and display. You uploaded your data to the \"data\" section, but now you'll want to go to the \"discover\" section. Under \"discover\" you can select your dataframe dataset for use. Once you've selected it, the Watson platform will suggest different insights to visualize. You can move forward with its selections or your own, or both. You can take a look at mine here (you'll need an account to view): https://ibm.co/2xAlAkq or see the screen shots attached to this repo. You can also go into the \"display\" section and create a shareable layout like mine (again you'll need an account): https://ibm.co/2A38Kg6.\n",

    "You can see that with these visualizations the user can see the impact of food insecurity by state, geographically distributed and used aid such as reduced school lunches, a map of diabetes by state, a predictive model for food insecurity and diabetes (showcasing the factors that, in combination, suggest a likelihood of food insecurity), drivers of adult diabetes, drivers of food insecurity, the relationship with the frequency of farmers market locations, food insecurity and adult obesity, as well as the relationship between farmers markets, the percent of the population that is Asian, food insecurity and poverty rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reviewing our visualizations both in DSX and Watson, we learn that obesity and diabetes almost go hand in hand, along with food insecurity. We can also learn that this seems to be an inequality issue, both in income and race, with Black and Hispanic populations being more heavily impacted by food insecurity and diet-related diseases than those of the White and Asian populations. We can also see that school-aged children who qualify for reduced lunch are more likely obese than not whereas those that have a farm-to-school program are more unlikely to be obese.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many data science investigations, this analysis could have a big impact on policy and people's approach to food insecurity in the U.S. What's best is that we can create many projects much like this in a quick time period and share them with others by using Pandas, Pixie Dust as well as Watson's predictive and recommended visualizations."
