IBM Journey showing how to visualize US Food Insecurity with Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics

Often in data science we do a great deal of work to glean insights that have an impact on society or a subset of it and yet, often, we end up not communicating it or communicating it ineffectively. That's where visualizations become themost powerful. By visualizing our insights and predictions, we, as data scientists and data lovers, can make a real impact and educate those around us that didn't have the opportunity to work on the same project. This journey walks you through how to do just that, with IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX), Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics.

### What is DSX, Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics and why should I care enough about them to use them for my visualizations?

IBM's Data Science Experience, or DSX, is an online browser platform where you can use notebooks or R Studio for your data science projects. DSX is unique in that it automatically starts up a Spark instance for you, allowing you to work in the cloud. DSX also has open data available to you, which you can connect to your notebook. There are also other projects available, in the form of notebooks, which you can follow along with and apply to your own use case. DSX also lets you save your work, share it and collaborate with others.

Pixie Dust is a visualization library you can use on DSX. It is already imported into DSX and it only requires one line of code (two words) to use. With that same line you can pick and choose different values to showcase and visualize in whichever way you want from matplotlib, seaborn and bokeh. If you have geographic data, you can also connect to google maps and Mapbox, depending on your preference.

IBM's Watson Analytics is another browser platform which allows you to input your data, conduct analysis on it and then visualize your findings. If you're new to data science, Watson recommends connections and visualizations with the data it's been given. These visualizations range from bar and scatter plots to predictive spirals, decision trees, heatmaps, trend lines and more. The Watson platform then allows you to share your findings and visualizations with others, completing your pipeline.
