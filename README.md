IBM Journey showing how to visualize US Food Insecurity with Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics

Often in data science we do a great deal of work to glean insights that have an impact on society or a subset of it and yet, often, we end up not communicating it or communicating it ineffectively. That's where visualizations become themost powerful. By visualizing our insights and predictions, we, as data scientists and data lovers, can make a real impact and educate those around us that didn't have the opportunity to work on the same project. This journey walks you through how to do just that, with IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX), Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics.

What is DSX, Pixie Dust and Watson Analytics and why should I care enough about them to use them for my visualizations?

Let's start with DSX.

Now, let's visualize with Pixie Dust.

Let's download our dataframe and work with it on Watson Analytics.
